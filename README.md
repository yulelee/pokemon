# CS221-pokemon

This is for the CS221 final project. Currently thinking about doing a pokemon catching AI.

# Current Ideas
(1) Given a limitied amount of time, how can the AI agent collect as many points as possible.
(2) Two agents compete in the game, if a pokemon is collected by one of the agents, the other one cannot collect it, for a given amout of time, the agent collect more points wins.
(3) Assume you are driving, the AI agent is arranging the route for you so that you can get as many points as possible, the routes should be updating in the real time.
